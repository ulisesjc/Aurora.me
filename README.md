# Aurora.me
Aurora Tracker Final Project for CSCI3308. This is my final project for my Software Development class at CU Boulder. This project allows you to calcuate your chances of seeing the aurora borealis based on your coordinates. It also has a social platform to view and share images with other people.

This project was made with a team of 5, following AGILE methodologies.

This project uses HTML/CSS for the frontend, Node.js for the middleware, and Express.js for the backend.
